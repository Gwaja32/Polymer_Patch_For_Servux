# Polymer_Patch_For_Servux

This is a patch for [Servux](https://modrinth.com/mod/servux) that fixes the phenomenon in which information from mod items using [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) is delivered to the client without being converted.
<br/>
Servux and Polymer are required, but not included in this mod.
<br/>
This mod was tested only for version 1.21.10.
