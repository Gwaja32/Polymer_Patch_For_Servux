# Polymer Patch For Servux

This is a patch for [Servux](https://modrinth.com/mod/servux) that works well as a server side that fixes the phenomenon that the information of the mod items using the [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) is not converted and is received to the client.  

Servux and Polymer are required, but not included in this mod.  

This mod was tested only for version 1.21.10.
